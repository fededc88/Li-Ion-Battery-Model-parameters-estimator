# Semi-Automatic Li-Ion battery RC model parameters estimator

Developed by ***Federico Ceccarelli***, in collaboration with 
[Martin Moya](https://github.com/moyamartin) and Lucio Santos, for a Li-Ion 
BMS.

Universidad Nacional de Rosario

Any kind of Submission are welcome to fededc88@gmail.com

The code implements a numerical optimization algorithm using Simulink Parameter 
Estimation, as part of the System Identification Toolbox, to estimate R y C 
parameter values of a second order Li-Ion  battery model 
(a series resistance R0 connected in series with two parallel R-C branches)
minimizing error between measured and simulated results.

For this example it was used a five pulses discharge HPPC test (0.5, 1, 2, 4, 
6C) performed at 100, 95, 90, 80, 70..., 30, 25, 20, 15, 10, 5, 0 SOC.
The data set was taken from the battery test performed at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison by *Dr. Phillip Kollmeyer* [[1]]
